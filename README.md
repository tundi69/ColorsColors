# ColorsColors
PC version of the good old board game, where you have to guess the 4-piece color sequence generated by the software. 
The computer will give you a feed-back after every guess, returns the number of hits, 
according to whether it is in the wrong place or in the right place compared to what is to be guessed.
Colors can be repeated.
Have a nice game! (without advertisements... :smile:)
